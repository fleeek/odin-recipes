        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner 
            than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to 
            avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you 
            have everything ready to go!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to 
            stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>4 pounds pork baby back ribs</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 cups ketchup</li>
                <li>1 cup chili sauce</li>
                <li>Â½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons vinegar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>   
                <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 dash hot sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:
        <ul>
            <li>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>2. Season ribs with salt and pepper. Place in a shallow baking pan. Brown in oven 15 minutes. Turn over, 
                and brown another 15 minutes; drain fat.</li>
            <li>3. In a medium bowl, mix together the ketchup, chili sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, oregano, Worcestershire 
                sauce, hot sauce, and salt and pepper. Place ribs in slow cooker. Pour sauce over ribs, and turn to coat.</li>
            <li>4. Cover, and cook on Low 6 to 8 hours, or until ribs are tender.</li>

        </ul>
