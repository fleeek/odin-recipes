        <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner 
            than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to 
            avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you 
            have everything ready to go!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
                <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
                <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:
        <ul>
            <li>1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large 
                cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
            <li>2. Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
            <li>3. Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will 
                prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment 
                (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately 
                smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper 
                leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
            <li>4.Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. 
                Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 
                4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the 
                cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite 
                toppings.</li>

        </ul>
